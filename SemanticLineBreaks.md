# Semantic Line Breaks

Semantic is defined as the meaning or interpretation of a word or sentence.

When writing text using a compatible markup language you add single line breaks after substantial units of thought.

## Why use Semantic Line Breaks? 

By inserting a semantic line break into a sentence or paragraph </br>
you can present your thoughts in the same way that they sound if spoken out loud.  
This allows the reader to understand your thoughts with the meaning that you intended.

The important thing to remember is that the semantic line breaks must be invisible to the reader; </br> 
in other words the reader should be able to read your thoughts fluently without it jarring or seeming stilted.

#### If we read the following paragraph:

**All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should  act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.**

The paragraph is one long, continuous line of text </br> and it will appear differently in browsers depending on the editor settings. </br> It feels like there is the slightest pause as you move to the third line. </br> When you read the paragraph it feels rushed and the meaning is not as clear. </br>
Placing a semantic line break after the first sentence makes the paragraph flow a little better:

**All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. </br>
They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.**

Placing another semantic line break after conscience makes the second sentence easier to understand </br> by distinguishing between the ‘and’ between reason and conscience </br> and the ‘and’ between conscience and should:

**All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. </br>
They are endowed with reason and conscience </br>
and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.**

Now the writer’s meaning is clear and we can ‘hear’ the sentence as the writer intended.

#### Rules of semantic line breaks:

* Must occur after a sentence ending with a period, exclamation mark or question mark;
* Must not alter the final rendered output of the document;
* Must not occur within a hyphenated word;
* Should not alter the intended meaning of the text;
* Should occur after a sentence ending with a comma, semicolon, colon or em dash;
* May occur within a sentence in order to clarify grammatical structure or to satisfy line length constraints
* May be used with plain text or markup language;
* Recommended before an itemised list
* May occur before or after a hyperlink
* Recommended before inline markup
* A maximum line length of 80 characters is recommended unless a hyperlink or other markup would be broken up
